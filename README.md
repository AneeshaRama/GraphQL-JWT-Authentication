##  **JWT AuthenticationüîíÔ∏è using GraphQL server**

This **backend** mini project is about authenticating user through **JWT** using **GraphQL server**.


### **What is GraphQL?**
GraphQL is a **query language** for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

### **What makes GraphQL better than REST API's?**
GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.
